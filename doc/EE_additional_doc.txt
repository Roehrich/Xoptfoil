In this version of Xoptfoil besides the standard functionalities of the JX version additional features are implemented:

-The minimum cp value may be specified in the constraints namelist for each operation point individually (default = -100). In order to do so add the variable min_cpmin to the constraints namelist.
Example:

&constraints
...
  min_cpmin(2)=-1.9
...  
/

-The x position of the first pressure increase on top and bottom side starting from stagnation point may be specified in the constraints namelist for each operation point individually (default = -1). In order to do so add the variable x_min_cp to the constraint namelist.
Example:

&constraints
...
  min_xacct(3)=0.2
  min_xaccb(4)=0.1
...
/

-The tripping location on both sides may be specified in the op-point namelist for each operation point individually (default = 1.0). In order to do so add the variable xtript_pt and/or xtripb_pt to the op namelist
If present the xtript_pt and xtripb_pt will overwrite an existing xtrip definition in the xfoil_run_options for the individual operation point.
It ist also possible to define tripping location relative to the stagnation point with negative values.
Example:

&operating_conditions
...
  xtript_pt(1) = 0.05
  xtripb_pt(1) = 0.1 
  xtript_pt(2) = -0.01
...
/

-Separation bubbles and separations can be penalized for each operation point. In order to do so add the variables xsepta and xseptb and/or xsepba and xsepbb to the constraints namelist
If present the  wall shear stress will be evaluated over the x interval xsepta - xseptb ("t" for "top" and x("a") < x("b")) and/or xsepba - xsepbb ("b" for "bot" and x("a") < x("b")) for the individual operation point.
Default values vor all x... is -1.0
Example:

&constraints
...
  xsepta(1) = 0.9
  xseptb(1) = 1.0
  xsepba(2) = 0
  xsepbb(2) = 1
...
/

-The boundary layer parameters are NOT altered!!!

SCCON     =  3.0	= Klag (default 5.6)	shear coefficient lag constant
DUXCON    =  0.5	= Uxwt (default 1.0)
GACON     =  6.8	= A    (default 6.7)	G-beta locus constants...
GBCON     =  0.85	= B	   (default 0.75)	G = GACON * sqrt(1.0 + GBCON*beta)

For documentation the other paramters are defined as:
XSTRIP(1) =  		= Xtr/c top side
XSTRIP(2) =  		= Xtr/c bottom side
ACRIT     =  		= Ncrit
TURB      =  		= % turb. level
VACCEL    =  		= Vacc
CTCON     =  		= KCt					Ctau weighting coefficient (implied by G-beta constants)
CTRCON    =  		= CtiniK
CTRCEX    =  		= CtiniX

-Default for ncrit in XFOIL has been changed to n=7

-number of operation points increased to 100

-the formating of outputs has been changed and the glide ratio, separation flag, cpmin and acceleration lenghts have been added to the results


The following source code has been modified compared to the original code (Version V1.60):
airfoil_evaluation.f90, input_output.F90, input_sanity.f90, optimization_driver.f90, polar_opartions.f90, vardef.f90, xfoil_aero.f, xfoil_driver.f90,

Multithreading has been enabled in main.def and CMakeLists.txt (due to solved problems with omp_lib - http://www.mathcancer.org/blog/setting-up-a-64-bit-gcc-environment-on-windows/)

CMakeLists.txt has been adapted in order to append "-EE" to name of executable
